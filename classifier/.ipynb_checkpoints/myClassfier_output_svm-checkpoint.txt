attacking the iraqis to drive them out of   |                                   
kuwait a country whose citizens have close  |                                   
blood and business ties to saudi citizens   |                                   
and me thinks if the us had not helped out  |                                   
the iraqis would have swallowed saudi       |                                   
arabia too or at least the eastern          |

much of anything to help liberate kuwait    |

very good idea to not have governments have |

they restrict religious and political       |                                   
reedom a lot among other things i just      |                                   
think that the most likely replacements for |                                   
them are going to be a lot worse for the    |                                   
citizens of the country but i think the     |                                   
house of saud is feeling the heat lately in |                                   
the last six months or so ive read there    |

western women not fully veiled something    |                                   
stupid for women to do imo because it sends |                                   
the wrong signals about your morality and   |                                   
ive read that theyve cracked down on the    |

expartiates who dare worship in their homes |                                   
or any other secret place so the government |                                   
has grown even more intolerant to try to    |                                   
take some of the wind out of the sails of   |                                   
the moreconservative opposition as          |                                   
unislamic as some of these things are       |                                   
theyre just a small taste of what would     |

can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis and in  |                                   
already very sick patients with damaged     |                                   
immune systems like aids and cancer         |                                   
patients systemic candida infection i think |                                   
the yeast connection is a bunch of hooey    |                                   
what does this have to do with how well     |                                   
nutrition is taught anyway elisabeth lets   |                                   
set the record straight for the nth time i  |                                   
have not read the yeast connection so       |                                   
anything that i say is not due to           |                                   
brainwashing by this hated book its okay i  |                                   
guess to hate the book by why hate me       |

covers this effect of antibiotic treatment  |                                   
as well as the cure i guess that your       |                                   
nutrition course does not too bad here is a |                                   
brief primer on yeast yeast infections as   |                                   
they are commonly called are not truely     |                                   
caused by yeasts the most common organism   |                                   
responsible for this type of infection is   |                                   
candida albicans or monilia which is        |                                   
actually a yeastlike fungus well maybe im   |                                   
getting picky but i always thought that a   |                                   
yeast was one form that a fungus could      |                                   
exist in the other being the mold form many |                                   
fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds   |                                   
depending on environment candida exibits    |                                   
what is known as reverse dimorphism it      |                                   
exists as a mold in the tissues but exists  |                                   
as a yeast in the environment should we     |                                   
maybe call it a mold infection a fungus     |                                   
infection maybe we should say it is caused  |

a little of steve dyer in you if you        |                                   
noticed my faculty rank im a biochemist not |                                   
a microbiologist candida is classifed as a  |                                   
fungusaccording to zinssers but as you      |                                   
point out it displays dimorphism it is      |                                   
capable of producing yeast cells            |                                   
pseudohyphae and true hyphae elisabeth you  |                                   
are probably a microbiologist and that      |                                   
makes a lot of sense to you to a biochemist |                                   
its a lot of greek so i called it a         |                                   
yeastlike fungus go ahead and crucify me    |                                   
you know elisabeth i still havent been able |                                   
to figure out why such a small little       |                                   
organism like candida can bring out so much |                                   
hostility in people in sci med and i must   |                                   
admitt that i got sucked into the mud       |                                   
slinging too i keep hoping that if people   |                                   
will just take the time to think about what |                                   
ive said that it will make sense im not     |                                   
asking anyone here to buy into the yeast    |                                   
connection book because i dont know whats   |

it is rape simple logic arguments are folly |                                   
if you read the bible you will see that     |                                   
jesus made fools of those who tried to      |                                   
trick him with logic our ability to reason  |                                   
is just a spec of creation yet some think   |                                   
it is the ultimate if you rely simply on    |                                   
your reason then you will never know more   |                                   
than you do now your argument is of the     |                                   
type youll know once you try yet there are  |                                   
many atheists who have sincerely tried and  |                                   
believed for many years but were eventually |                                   
honest enough to admit that they had lived  |                                   
in a virtual reality obviously there are    |                                   
many christians who have tried and do       |                                   
believe so so nothing it may work for some  |                                   
but not for others it doesnt give any       |                                   
insight into an overall god or overall      |                                   
truth of a religion it would seem to be     |                                   
dependent solely on the individual as well  |                                   
as individuallycreated and since christians |                                   
have failed to show us how there way of     |                                   
life is in any wy better than ours i do not |                                   
see why the attempt to try it is necessary  |                                   
or even particularly attractive to learn    |                                   
you must accept that which you dont know    |                                   
what does this mean to learn you must       |                                   
accept that you dont know something righto  |                                   
but to learn you must _accept_ something i  |                                   
dont know why this is not the way i prefer  |                                   
to learn it is unwise to merely swallow     |                                   
everything you read suppose i write a book  |                                   
telling how the great invisible pink        |                                   
unicorn tm has helped me in my daily        |                                   
problems would you accept this since you    |                                   
cant know whether it is true or not no one  |                                   
asks you to swallow everything in fact      |                                   
jesus warns against it but let me ask you a |                                   
question do you beleive what you learn in   |

have an eisa machine and i just do not      |                                   
understand why most eisa video cards only   |                                   
match the performance of their isa          |                                   
counterparts for instance the eisa orchid   |                                   
pro designer iise is only about as fast as  |                                   
the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt   |                                   
what i would call fast i dont understand    |                                   
why eisa video cards arent as a group on    |                                   
the same level of performance as local bus  |                                   
cards given that eisa video cards have a 32 |                                   
bit bus to move data around instead of isas |                                   
8 bits good question answer the eisa bus    |                                   
does move 32 bits rather than isas 816 but  |                                   
it still moves it at about the speed as the |                                   
isa bus i think thats either 8 or 10 mhz    |                                   
the local bus designs also move 32 bits     |                                   
like the eisa but they move the data at the |                                   
cpu speed up to 40 mhz so on a 33mhz cpu    |                                   
the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33    | Running Time:            0.04514  
mhz and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8  | Query Exceeded:          no       
or 10 mhz so the local bus should be 3 to 4 | Victim Model Queries:    403      
times faster than eisa on a 33 mhz cpu eisa | Succeed:                 no       
should be about two maybe 3 times as fast   |                                   
as isa since they are not why would anyone  |                                   
me included pay a higher cost for a eisa    |                                   
video card when its performance is no       |                                   
better than and often worse that a much     |                                   
cheaper isa video board such as a diamond   |                                   
speedstar 24x from pc magazines i think     |                                   
recent report i know that ati makes a       |                                   
pretty fast eisa video card but its around  |                                   
500 which is just about double what my      |                                   
wallet will allow me to spend and for 500 i |                                   
could get a diamond viper and still have    |

local bus mother board too thats a very     |                                   
good question the eisa bus does have more   |                                   
advantages over the isa bus than just its   |                                   
width for example morebetter interrupts and |                                   
bus mastering but these other factors do    |                                   
not impact a video card very much they have |

they checked the transmission it was ok i   |                                   
had the exact problem a couple of months    |                                   
ago and again last week the dealer says     |                                   
there is nothing they can do because        |                                   
mitsubishi the 800 says they have never     |                                   
heard of the problem and the dealer could   |                                   
not reproduce the problem while they had    |                                   
the car in all three occurances the car was |                                   
parked head first in a garage and since the |                                   
front wheels were stuck the car could not   |                                   
be towed to the dealer before releasing the |                                   
shifter hence temporarily solving the       |                                   
problem and the dealer and mitsubishi       |                                   
refused to send someone to check the car    |                                   
while it was stuck i know there is smething |                                   
wrong with the transmission shifting from   |                                   
2nd to 3rd and getting stuck at random but  |

the problem it seems to me that if we were  |                                   
to plot all the players in baseball in      |

supposition is that if we were to find the  |

conclusions about those players as opposed  |

here if players performance was completely  |

still expect some players to be good in the |                                   
clutch every year and some to be notsogood  |                                   
every year with two years worth of data     |                                   
youd have 14 of the players good each year  |                                   
14 bad each year and 12 would have one good |

patrick roy is the reason the game was lost |                                   
and ron hextall is the reason quebec won i  |                                   
dont buy this at all roy was the reason the |                                   
game was tied and that would not have been  |                                   
the case had dionne kept his cool roy stood |                                   
on his head for the first 15 minutes of the |                                   
game when the nords were rushing from       |                                   
endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the      |                                   
tying goal and the first shot by young in   |                                   
ot were both excellent chances stopped by   |                                   
roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the   |                                   
game but roy becomes the villain and        |                                   
hextall the hero because roys team didnt    |                                   
make full use of their opportunities whoa   |                                   
what you are effectively doing is implying  |                                   
that if a player plays really well he       |                                   
stores up mistakes that can be used at a    |                                   
later time ths is not so roy is the villain |                                   
as you so succinctly put it because he      |                                   
allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy  |                                   
outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a  |                                   
tape of the game and watch the first 78     |                                   
minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders |                                   
_make_ some great saves if they did not     |                                   
they would not be in the nhl in the first   |                                   
place i do not expect any particular goalie |                                   
to be able to make the great saves all of   |                                   
the time even though they are occasionally  |                                   
required however when it comes to a routine |                                   
shot like sakics especially at such a       |                                   
crucial time in a game i dont think there   |                                   
are any legitimate excuses hextall on the   |                                   
other hand had a lot of lucky bounces       |                                   
description of lucky bounces hextall wasnt  |                                   
particularly brilliant on those plays i am  |                                   
not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am |                                   
arguing is that a relatively weak wrist     |                                   
shot from the outside of the circle shold   |                                   
not result in a goal but it was just the 1  |                                   
goal the timing stank but against an        |                                   
explosive team like quebec they gave them 1 |                                   
opportunity too many with a powerplay that  | Running Time:            0.1521   
was totally unnecessary in a onegoal game   | Query Exceeded:          no       
with less than a minute to go there is no   | Victim Model Queries:    821      
such thing as just the 1 goal i have not    | Succeed:                 no       
defended dionne for taking the penalty      |                                   
eitherin fact i think it was a boneheaded   |                                   
move but it led to _one_ goal only and      |                                   
montreal had a _two_ goal lead my main      |                                   
concern is the second goal this most        |                                   
certainly was a team loss leclair missed    |                                   
his opportunities as did bellows and brunet |                                   
dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and    |                                   
lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard    |                                   
were a step behind all night roy gave up    |                                   
the bad goal roy by no means can be singled |                                   
out for this loss what you say about the    |                                   
skaters is absolutely true but realize that |                                   
the game was effectively won you could      |                                   
watch any hockey game in fact you could     |                                   
watch any sporting event period and spend   |                                   
hours discussing the what ifs wrt missed    |                                   
opportunities they are not important when   |                                   
the final result is decided if i get the    |                                   
time soon ill watch the game again and      |                                   
email you a list of lucky montreal bounces  |                                   
and a list of quebec offensive screwups     |                                   
montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go  |                                   
the goalie is the last line of defence and  |                                   
i will grant that extra attention is        |                                   
focussed on him sometimes without           |                                   
justification but roy gave up a lousy goal  |                                   
and a team cannot afford such a goal roy    |                                   
looked like a player in an industrial       |                                   
league on sakics shot and hextall didnt on  |                                   
dionnes goal please who cares of what value |                                   
is it to justify one lousy play with a      |                                   
totally unrelated lousy play i could do a   |                                   
hextall critique if youd like but if youre  |                                   
going to assess his performance keep in     |                                   
mind that he made the key saves at the key  |                                   
times roy is paid big money because that is |                                   
his value compared to other goalies and he  |                                   
still is in the top 5 for the record i did  |                                   
not say that roy was not one of the top     |                                   
goaltenders in the league in fact i agree   |                                   
that he is the montreal media is the        |                                   
quickest to heap praise and then hurl       |                                   
derogatory comments against the habs they   |                                   
are no better than uninformed fans i assume |                                   
you are referring to me however i have      |                                   
pointed out that i think the loss can be    |

do i think ive made any other derogatory    |
