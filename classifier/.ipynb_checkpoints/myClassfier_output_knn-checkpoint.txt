house of saud is feeling the heat lately in |

that most us medical schools dont cover     |

set the record straight for the nth time i  |                                   
have not read the yeast connection so       |                                   
anything that i say is not due to           |                                   
brainwashing by this hated book its okay i  |                                   
guess to hate the book by why hate me       |

getting picky but i always thought that a   |

have an eisa machine and i just do not      |                                   
understand why most eisa video cards only   |                                   
match the performance of their isa          |                                   
counterparts for instance the eisa orchid   |                                   
pro designer iise is only about as fast as  |                                   
the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt   |                                   
what i would call fast i dont understand    |                                   
why eisa video cards arent as a group on    |                                   
the same level of performance as local bus  |                                   
cards given that eisa video cards have a 32 |                                   
bit bus to move data around instead of isas |                                   
8 bits good question answer the eisa bus    |                                   
does move 32 bits rather than isas 816 but  |                                   
it still moves it at about the speed as the |                                   
isa bus i think thats either 8 or 10 mhz    |                                   
the local bus designs also move 32 bits     |                                   
like the eisa but they move the data at the |                                   
cpu speed up to 40 mhz so on a 33mhz cpu    |                                   
the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33    | Running Time:            0.031378 
mhz and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8  | Query Exceeded:          no       
or 10 mhz so the local bus should be 3 to 4 | Victim Model Queries:    403      
times faster than eisa on a 33 mhz cpu eisa | Succeed:                 no       
should be about two maybe 3 times as fast   |                                   
as isa since they are not why would anyone  |                                   
me included pay a higher cost for a eisa    |                                   
video card when its performance is no       |                                   
better than and often worse that a much     |                                   
cheaper isa video board such as a diamond   |                                   
speedstar 24x from pc magazines i think     |                                   
recent report i know that ati makes a       |                                   
pretty fast eisa video card but its around  |                                   
500 which is just about double what my      |                                   
wallet will allow me to spend and for 500 i |                                   
could get a diamond viper and still have    |                                   
100 left over of course id have to get a    |                                   
local bus mother board too thats a very     |                                   
good question the eisa bus does have more   |                                   
advantages over the isa bus than just its   |                                   
width for example morebetter interrupts and |                                   
bus mastering but these other factors do    |                                   
not impact a video card very much they have |

muslims in the bosnian context bosnian      |                                   
muslims are citizens od bosniaherzegovina   |                                   
who identify themselves with bosnian muslim |                                   
cultural and religious tradition i know     |                                   
that a moslemmuslim is a believer in islam  |                                   
islam is a religion and it is practised in  |                                   
many parts of the world but it is not yes   |                                   
definitely not an ethinic group ok so these |                                   
bosnian muslims who are they to which       |

language from that of the serbs or croats   |                                   
in bosnia muslim is not merely a religious  |                                   
category but an ethnic one as well actually |                                   
here are the two contradictory arguments    |                                   
made by people on this subject 1 there is   |                                   
only serbian and croatian nationality and   |                                   
bosnian muslims are simply croats and serbs |                                   
of islamic faith 2 bosnian muslims are a    |                                   
separate nationality since they do not feel |                                   
themselves to be croats nor serbs in 1968   |                                   
argument 2 was accepted by former           |                                   
yugoslavia as valid and 1 was soundly       |                                   
rejected the reasons are pragmatic even if  |                                   
bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who    |                                   
converted to islam under turkish rule       |

ancestors actual nationality in fact        |

croatian or serbian national allegiance     |                                   
most of them feel they have a separate      |                                   
cultural and historic identity so arguments |                                   
like yes but your ancestors were croats or  |                                   
serbs carry very little weight regardless   |                                   
of what their ancestors might have been as  |

former yugoslavia the date is 1971 when     |

refused to send someone to check the car    |                                   
while it was stuck i know there is smething |                                   
wrong with the transmission shifting from   |                                   
2nd to 3rd and getting stuck at random but  |                                   
i cant get the dealer to fix it i need your |

think the largescale sample size is part of |                                   
the problem it seems to me that if we were  |                                   
to plot all the players in baseball in      |                                   
regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we      |                                   
would get some kind of bell curve the xaxis |                                   
being the deviation in clutch hitting vs    |                                   
nonclutch the yaxis being the number of     |                                   
players certainly there would be some       |                                   
players on the extreme ends of the bell my  |                                   
supposition is that if we were to find the  |                                   
same players consistently year after year   |                                   
at one end of the bell or the other then we |                                   
might be able to make some reasonable       |                                   
conclusions about those players as opposed  |                                   
to all baseball players lets be careful     |                                   
here if players performance was completely  |                                   
random in clutchno clutch then you would    |                                   
still expect some players to be good in the |                                   
clutch every year and some to be notsogood  |                                   
every year with two years worth of data     |                                   
youd have 14 of the players good each year  |                                   
14 bad each year and 12 would have one good |                                   
and one bad year we have 96 players for 5   |                                   
years 8488 just flipping a coin youd expect |

years 8487 that i looked at the data from   |                                   
elias there were 79 29 players with a       |                                   
minimum of 25 50 at bats in clutch          |                                   
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean  |                                   
two different years of those 79 29 players  |                                   
38 14 of them changed sign between the two  |                                   
years in other words they were great clutch |                                   
hitters one year and really horrible the    |                                   
other year if it was just a random process  |                                   
youd expect those numbers to be 395 145     |                                   
everything thats been measured about clutch |

random process with the caveat that there   |                                   
may be something related to platoon         |                                   
advantage that could be dragged out of the  |                                   
dataeg john lowenstein probably never had a |                                   
clutch ab against a lefthanded pitcher but  |                                   
he might well have had some in blowouts so  |                                   
that there would be a bias since his clutch |

as you so succinctly put it because he      |                                   
allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy  |                                   
outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a  |                                   
tape of the game and watch the first 78     |                                   
minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders |                                   
_make_ some great saves if they did not     |                                   
they would not be in the nhl in the first   |

to be able to make the great saves all of   |                                   
the time even though they are occasionally  |                                   
required however when it comes to a routine |                                   
shot like sakics especially at such a       |                                   
crucial time in a game i dont think there   |                                   
are any legitimate excuses hextall on the   |                                   
other hand had a lot of lucky bounces       |                                   
description of lucky bounces hextall wasnt  |                                   
particularly brilliant on those plays i am  |                                   
not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am |                                   
arguing is that a relatively weak wrist     |                                   
shot from the outside of the circle shold   |                                   
not result in a goal but it was just the 1  |                                   
goal the timing stank but against an        |                                   
explosive team like quebec they gave them 1 |                                   
opportunity too many with a powerplay that  | Running Time:            0.11712

such thing as just the 1 goal i have not    | Succeed:                 no       
defended dionne for taking the penalty      |                                   
eitherin fact i think it was a boneheaded   |                                   
move but it led to _one_ goal only and      |                                   
montreal had a _two_ goal lead my main      |                                   
concern is the second goal this most        |                                   
certainly was a team loss leclair missed    |                                   
his opportunities as did bellows and brunet |                                   
dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and    |                                   
lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard    |                                   
were a step behind all night roy gave up    |                                   
the bad goal roy by no means can be singled |                                   
out for this loss what you say about the    |                                   
skaters is absolutely true but realize that |                                   
the game was effectively won you could      |                                   
watch any hockey game in fact you could     |                                   
watch any sporting event period and spend   |                                   
hours discussing the what ifs wrt missed    |

the final result is decided if i get the    |                                   
time soon ill watch the game again and      |                                   
email you a list of lucky montreal bounces  |                                   
and a list of quebec offensive screwups     |                                   
montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go  |                                   
the goalie is the last line of defence and  |                                   
i will grant that extra attention is        |                                   
focussed on him sometimes without           |                                   
justification but roy gave up a lousy goal  |                                   
and a team cannot afford such a goal roy    |                                   
looked like a player in an industrial       |

dionnes goal please who cares of what value |                                   
is it to justify one lousy play with a      |                                   
totally unrelated lousy play i could do a   |                                   
hextall critique if youd like but if youre  |                                   
going to assess his performance keep in     |                                   
mind that he made the key saves at the key  |                                   
times roy is paid big money because that is |                                   
his value compared to other goalies and he  |                                   
still is in the top 5 for the record i did  |                                   
not say that roy was not one of the top     |                                   
goaltenders in the league in fact i agree   |                                   
that he is the montreal media is the        |
