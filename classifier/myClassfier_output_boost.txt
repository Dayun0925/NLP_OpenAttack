practicing in the us its really too bad     |                                   
that most us medical schools dont cover     |                                   
nutrition because if they did candida would |

already very sick patients with damaged     |                                   
immune systems like aids and cancer         |                                   
patients systemic candida infection i think |                                   
the yeast connection is a bunch of hooey    |                                   
what does this have to do with how well     |                                   
nutrition is taught anyway elisabeth lets   |                                   
set the record straight for the nth time i  |                                   
have not read the yeast connection so       |                                   
anything that i say is not due to           |                                   
brainwashing by this hated book its okay i  |                                   
guess to hate the book by why hate me       |                                   
elisabeth im going to quote from zinssers   |                                   
microbiology 20th edition a book that you   |                                   
should be familiar with and not hate        |                                   
candida species colonize the mucosal        |

shortly thereafter the risk of endogenous   |                                   
infection is clearly ever present indeed    |                                   
candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the     |                                   
most common systemic mycosis neutrophils    |                                   
play the main role in preventing a systemic |                                   
infectioncandidiasis so you would have to   |                                   
have a low neutrophil count or sick         |

poor diet and persistent parasitic          |                                   
infestation set many third world residents  |                                   
up for candidiasis your assessment of       |                                   
candidiasis in the us is correct and i do   |

mucosal infections i like the term blooms   |                                   
better the nutrition course that i teach    |

candida albicans or monilia which is        |                                   
actually a yeastlike fungus well maybe im   |                                   
getting picky but i always thought that a   |                                   
yeast was one form that a fungus could      |                                   
exist in the other being the mold form many |

as a yeast in the environment should we     |                                   
maybe call it a mold infection a fungus     |

have an eisa machine and i just do not      |                                   
understand why most eisa video cards only   |                                   
match the performance of their isa          |                                   
counterparts for instance the eisa orchid   |                                   
pro designer iise is only about as fast as  |                                   
the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt   |                                   
what i would call fast i dont understand    |                                   
why eisa video cards arent as a group on    |                                   
the same level of performance as local bus  |                                   
cards given that eisa video cards have a 32 |                                   
bit bus to move data around instead of isas |                                   
8 bits good question answer the eisa bus    |                                   
does move 32 bits rather than isas 816 but  |                                   
it still moves it at about the speed as the |                                   
isa bus i think thats either 8 or 10 mhz    |                                   
the local bus designs also move 32 bits     |                                   
like the eisa but they move the data at the |                                   
cpu speed up to 40 mhz so on a 33mhz cpu    |                                   
the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33    | Running Time:            0.028359 
mhz and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8  | Query Exceeded:          no       
or 10 mhz so the local bus should be 3 to 4 | Victim Model Queries:    403      
times faster than eisa on a 33 mhz cpu eisa | Succeed:                 no       
should be about two maybe 3 times as fast   |                                   
as isa since they are not why would anyone  |                                   
me included pay a higher cost for a eisa    |                                   
video card when its performance is no       |                                   
better than and often worse that a much     |                                   
cheaper isa video board such as a diamond   |                                   
speedstar 24x from pc magazines i think     |                                   
recent report i know that ati makes a       |                                   
pretty fast eisa video card but its around  |                                   
500 which is just about double what my      |                                   
wallet will allow me to spend and for 500 i |                                   
could get a diamond viper and still have    |                                   
100 left over of course id have to get a    |                                   
local bus mother board too thats a very     |                                   
good question the eisa bus does have more   |                                   
advantages over the isa bus than just its   |                                   
width for example morebetter interrupts and |                                   
bus mastering but these other factors do    |                                   
not impact a video card very much they have |                                   
more impact on file servers with multiple   |

unless i do it slowly and carefully it      |                                   
makes a popping or hitting sound the dealer |                                   
and mitsubishi customer service reached by  |                                   
an 800 say this is normal for the car is it |                                   
and about a year ago at 35kmiles the stick  |                                   
shift handle got stuck while attempting to  |                                   
put it in reverse 1 the shifter would not   |

that when this happened i took it to the    |                                   
dealer they checked the clutch it was ok    |                                   
they checked the transmission it was ok i   |                                   
had the exact problem a couple of months    |                                   
ago and again last week the dealer says     |                                   
there is nothing they can do because        |                                   
mitsubishi the 800 says they have never     |                                   
heard of the problem and the dealer could   |                                   
not reproduce the problem while they had    |                                   
the car in all three occurances the car was |                                   
parked head first in a garage and since the |                                   
front wheels were stuck the car could not   |                                   
be towed to the dealer before releasing the |                                   
shifter hence temporarily solving the       |                                   
problem and the dealer and mitsubishi       |                                   
refused to send someone to check the car    |                                   
while it was stuck i know there is smething |                                   
wrong with the transmission shifting from   |                                   
2nd to 3rd and getting stuck at random but  |                                   
i cant get the dealer to fix it i need your |                                   
help with the mechanical problems and with  |

conceived before the array replacemnet was  |

reboost will occur with the arrays deployed |                                   
or not however it doesnt appear that an     |                                   
array retraction was necessary for reboost  |

think the largescale sample size is part of |                                   
the problem it seems to me that if we were  |                                   
to plot all the players in baseball in      |                                   
regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we      |                                   
would get some kind of bell curve the xaxis |                                   
being the deviation in clutch hitting vs    |                                   
nonclutch the yaxis being the number of     |                                   
players certainly there would be some       |                                   
players on the extreme ends of the bell my  |                                   
supposition is that if we were to find the  |                                   
same players consistently year after year   |                                   
at one end of the bell or the other then we |                                   
might be able to make some reasonable       |                                   
conclusions about those players as opposed  |                                   
to all baseball players lets be careful     |                                   
here if players performance was completely  |                                   
random in clutchno clutch then you would    |                                   
still expect some players to be good in the |                                   
clutch every year and some to be notsogood  |

ref presently in the nhl we was robbed no   |                                   
patrick roy is the reason the game was lost |                                   
and ron hextall is the reason quebec won i  |                                   
dont buy this at all roy was the reason the |                                   
game was tied and that would not have been  |                                   
the case had dionne kept his cool roy stood |                                   
on his head for the first 15 minutes of the |                                   
game when the nords were rushing from       |                                   
endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the      |                                   
tying goal and the first shot by young in   |                                   
ot were both excellent chances stopped by   |                                   
roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the   |                                   
game but roy becomes the villain and        |                                   
hextall the hero because roys team didnt    |                                   
make full use of their opportunities whoa   |                                   
what you are effectively doing is implying  |                                   
that if a player plays really well he       |                                   
stores up mistakes that can be used at a    |                                   
later time ths is not so roy is the villain |                                   
as you so succinctly put it because he      |                                   
allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy  |                                   
outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a  |                                   
tape of the game and watch the first 78     |                                   
minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders |                                   
_make_ some great saves if they did not     |                                   
they would not be in the nhl in the first   |                                   
place i do not expect any particular goalie |                                   
to be able to make the great saves all of   |                                   
the time even though they are occasionally  |                                   
required however when it comes to a routine |                                   
shot like sakics especially at such a       |                                   
crucial time in a game i dont think there   |                                   
are any legitimate excuses hextall on the   |                                   
other hand had a lot of lucky bounces       |                                   
description of lucky bounces hextall wasnt  |                                   
particularly brilliant on those plays i am  |                                   
not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am |                                   
arguing is that a relatively weak wrist     |                                   
shot from the outside of the circle shold   |                                   
not result in a goal but it was just the 1  |                                   
goal the timing stank but against an        |                                   
explosive team like quebec they gave them 1 |                                   
opportunity too many with a powerplay that  | Running Time:            0.10551  
was totally unnecessary in a onegoal game   | Query Exceeded:          no       
with less than a minute to go there is no   | Victim Model Queries:    821      
such thing as just the 1 goal i have not    | Succeed:                 no       
defended dionne for taking the penalty      |                                   
eitherin fact i think it was a boneheaded   |                                   
move but it led to _one_ goal only and      |                                   
montreal had a _two_ goal lead my main      |                                   
concern is the second goal this most        |                                   
certainly was a team loss leclair missed    |                                   
his opportunities as did bellows and brunet |                                   
dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and    |                                   
lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard    |                                   
were a step behind all night roy gave up    |                                   
the bad goal roy by no means can be singled |                                   
out for this loss what you say about the    |                                   
skaters is absolutely true but realize that |                                   
the game was effectively won you could      |                                   
watch any hockey game in fact you could     |                                   
watch any sporting event period and spend   |                                   
hours discussing the what ifs wrt missed    |                                   
opportunities they are not important when   |                                   
the final result is decided if i get the    |                                   
time soon ill watch the game again and      |                                   
email you a list of lucky montreal bounces  |                                   
and a list of quebec offensive screwups     |                                   
montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go  |                                   
the goalie is the last line of defence and  |                                   
i will grant that extra attention is        |                                   
focussed on him sometimes without           |                                   
justification but roy gave up a lousy goal  |                                   
and a team cannot afford such a goal roy    |                                   
looked like a player in an industrial       |                                   
league on sakics shot and hextall didnt on  |                                   
dionnes goal please who cares of what value |                                   
is it to justify one lousy play with a      |                                   
totally unrelated lousy play i could do a   |                                   
hextall critique if youd like but if youre  |                                   
going to assess his performance keep in     |                                   
mind that he made the key saves at the key  |                                   
times roy is paid big money because that is |                                   
his value compared to other goalies and he  |                                   
still is in the top 5 for the record i did  |                                   
not say that roy was not one of the top     |                                   
goaltenders in the league in fact i agree   |                                   
that he is the montreal media is the        |                                   
quickest to heap praise and then hurl       |                                   
derogatory comments against the habs they   |                                   
are no better than uninformed fans i assume |                                   
you are referring to me however i have      |                                   
pointed out that i think the loss can be    |
